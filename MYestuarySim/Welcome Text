Hello, and welcome to Aestus! My name is Maggie. In a few moments, I will take you to 
the estuary. Your mission is to identify and remove the invasive species while keeping the native 
species happy and healthy. Beware, the grasses keep growing, and may over-grow the space! 
Also, keep an eye out for pieces of trash and pollution littering the area. Let's go!
